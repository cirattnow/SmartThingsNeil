# The above 'secure' field contains the cyphertext that resulted from encrypting the string "GITHUB_TOKEN=x", where x is a github personal token, which 
# I generated in the github web interface (https://github.com/settings/tokens).  	The encryption was performed by me, on my own computer,
# using the travis command-line utility (which I installed by running "gem install travis"); the command to generate the above cyphertext and
# add it to this .travis.yml file was  "travis encrypt GITHUB_TOKEN=x --add env.global", where, once again,
# I have cleverly substituted 'x' for the actual token, which only I know (or so github tells me) (and I have since forgotten the original token anyway, 
# so don't bother asking me for it).
# The 'travis encrypt' command looks up online the publicly available public member of the public-private key pair that Travis has generated just for this particular 
# git repository.  Travis keeps the private member of that pair secret (or so they tell me).  By encrypting the plain text with the public member of the pair,
# I am assured that the only person who can succesfully recover the plaintext is the person who knows the secret private member of the pair (which is Travis). 
# (Or so my math professor tells me, and the NSA is quick to agree.)
# Travis could, if it were so inclined, download the above cyphertext from my publicly available public github repository, and then decrypt it
# with its private key, and then publish the plaintext in a full page ad in the New York Times, along with a message inviting any and all arbitrary yahoos to push 
# to my public github repositories (until I figured out what was happening and disabled that github personal token).  However, Travis knows 
# that if they violate my trust in such a manner, I will be inclined to take my business elsewhere; Travis will have to say goodbye to my 
# substantial monthly payment.  Oh, wait, I just remembered - I don't pay Travis anything because I have  a free account. Let me rethink this...

# My security here relies not only on Travis to keep their private member of the key pair (and the plaintext that they can decrypt using that key) a secret, but 
# also - and this is the more likely weak link - on me not to accidentally run some command as part of the travis build process that writes the plaintext to
# stdout, where it will be logged and made publicly avilable by Travis in the console transcript for the build.

# The github personal access token acts like an alternate password for my github account, which is used along with my normal github username.
# github allows me to revoke this alternate password at will, and also to limit the permissions that a user who has logged in with the 
# alternate password may have.  It would be nice to be able to restrict the repositories that the alternate-password form of the credentials
# were allowed to touch, but I have not found anything in the github settings pages indicating that this is possible; it looks like the alternate-password 
# form of the credentials has the same permissions for all of my github repositories.
